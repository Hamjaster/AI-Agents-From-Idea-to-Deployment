Agentic AI Workshop Reference Notes
===================================

Overview
--------
This workshop guides participants through building multi-agent systems with CrewAI, LangChain, FAISS-based RAG pipelines, Streamlit frontends, and the OpenRouter API. The curriculum follows a plan-first approach where a planning agent drafts the roadmap, a research agent sources evidence, a writer agent creates instructional content, and a reviewer agent ensures quality.

Key Concepts
------------
- CrewAI enables orchestration of specialized agents with shared tools, tasks, and sequential or parallel processes.
- LangChain integrates LLM reasoning with retrieval, web search, and calculation utilities.
- FAISS provides efficient similarity search over document embeddings, enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- OpenRouter offers a unified API for multiple cutting-edge models, including Meta Llama 3.3.
- Streamlit delivers rapid, interactive frontends for AI workflows.

Deployment Tips
---------------
1. Always secure API keys using environment variables or secret managers.
2. Pre-build vector stores to avoid latency spikes during live sessions.
3. Log agent outputs for instructor review and iterative improvements.
4. Encourage students to customize prompts, tasks, and toolkits to explore the impact on agent behavior.

Suggested Agenda
----------------
1. Introduction to agentic workflows and CrewAI basics.
2. Building a knowledge base and FAISS vector store.
3. Designing specialist agents with prompts, goals, and tools.
4. Wiring tasks and running the crew end-to-end.
5. Deploying a Streamlit interface to surface outputs.
6. Extending the system with new tools, evaluation metrics, or deployment targets.
